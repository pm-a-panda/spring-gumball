# Pre-Lab Installations
In order to complete the lab, we were required to download the following:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack
https://sdkman.io

Ubuntu 20.04 was also installed since the lab required WSL2 instead of WSL1 to function. It was found that Ubuntu and Ubuntu 18.04 did not support WSL2.

We were also required to create an account in the following to get access to its resources.
